# Velodyne Simulation Package

## Overview

Welcome to the Velodyne Simulation Package, your go-to solution for simulating Velodyne laser scanners. This package provides URDF descriptions and Gazebo plugins to emulate the behavior of Velodyne sensors in a virtual environment, offering a powerful tool for testing and developing robotics algorithms and perception systems.

## Key Features

- **Rich URDF Descriptions:** Benefit from URDF descriptions that include vibrant colored meshes, enhancing the visual appeal of your simulated environment.

- **Gazebo Plugin Integration:** Leveraging the capabilities of [gazebo_plugins/gazebo_ros_block_laser](https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/blob/kinetic-devel/gazebo_plugins/src/gazebo_ros_block_laser.cpp), the Gazebo plugin faithfully replicates the behavior of Velodyne laser scanners.

- **PointCloud2 Output:** The simulation generates PointCloud2 messages with a consistent structure, providing detailed information such as Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z), intensity, and ring.

- **Realistic Noise Simulation:** Mimic real-world conditions with simulated Gaussian noise, adding a layer of authenticity to your sensor data.

- **GPU Acceleration:** Optimize performance by taking advantage of GPU acceleration. Ensure compatibility with a modern Gazebo build for optimal results.

- **Model Variety:** Currently supporting the VLP-16 and HDL-32E models, the package welcomes contributions in the form of pull requests for additional Velodyne sensor models.

- **Experimental Low-Intensity Clipping:** Explore experimental features that enable the clipping of low-intensity returns, allowing for more refined data filtering.

## Configuration Parameters

Fine-tune your simulation with a range of customizable parameters, tailoring the behavior of the simulated sensors to your specific needs. Key parameters include:

- **origin:** Define the URDF transform from the parent link.
- **parent:** Specify the URDF parent link name (default: `base_link`).
- **name:** Set the URDF model name and tf frame_id for PointCloud2 output (default: `velodyne`).
- **topic:** Define the PointCloud2 output topic name (default: `/velodyne_points`).
- **hz:** Adjust the update rate in hertz (default: `10`).
- **lasers:** Configure the number of vertical spinning lasers (default: VLP-16: `16`, HDL-32E: `32`).
- **samples:** Determine the number of horizontal rotating samples (default: VLP-16: `1875`, HDL-32E: `2187`).
- **min_range:** Set the minimum range value in meters (default: `0.9`).
- **max_range:** Define the maximum range value in meters (default: `130.0`).
- **noise:** Introduce Gaussian noise in meters (default: `0.008`).
- **min_angle:** Specify the minimum horizontal angle in radians (default: `-3.14`).
- **max_angle:** Adjust the maximum horizontal angle in radians (default: `3.14`).
- **gpu:** Enable GPU-accelerated ray sensors instead of the standard ray sensor (default: `false`).
- **min_intensity:** Set the minimum intensity threshold for clipping low-intensity returns.

## Known Issues and Solutions

- **Extended Gazebo Loading Times:** Full sample resolution may result in longer Gazebo loading times.

- **Range Inaccuracies with GPU Acceleration:** Upgrade to a modern Gazebo version to address range inaccuracies.

- **Reduced Gazebo Update Rate:** Users can optimize the update rate by adjusting the number of points or frequency in the URDF parameters.

- **Crashes with HDL-32E Sensors:** To prevent crashes, reduce the number of points in the URDF configuration.

- **Z Orientation Differences in Gazebo Versions:** Maintain separate branches for URDF changes when dealing with different Gazebo versions.

## Example Usage

### Standard Launch
```bash
roslaunch velodyne_description example.launch
```

### Launch with GPU Acceleration
```bash
roslaunch velodyne_description example.launch gpu:=true
```

Feel free to explore and experiment with various configurations based on your specific simulation requirements!
